# BikeShares_NYK
# Introduction 
Bicycles are seen more use than before this is thanks to 2 aspects, the ecological aspect where using bicycles is healthier for the environment do to less production of carbon dioxide per person and the economic aspect because it is getting difficult to buy personal accommodates like houses or cars, so to bring this idea to other cities we have the case study of New York City,  as an example we have the paper from Campbell and Brakewood (2017) where they found that there is an increase in bicycles and the use of buses is declining and most of the bicycles from this study came from bikesharing docks so this creates an opportunity for a new business if we are able to implement it like they did, so we are going to look through tendencies to see which are the main conditions for it to work.

# Results 
The first five minutes where the most important for the use of bicycles, around 150 thousand people used this bicycle only for this time period as seen in the first figure, after that it declined to 40 thousand individuals at the 20-minute mark and 8 thousand at the 40 minute mark, after the first hour it had a tendency to stay near the 200 mark and at the second hour it stayed below 100 bikes. Although this means they stayed nearby this study was focused only on Manhattan and Brooklyn some of the most known parts of New York and famous for the tourist.

fig 2. Trip duration for the first 2 hours of the bicycle rides divided by gender and unknown gender.

More than 70% of the people that used bikes where man at the 5-minute mark (fig 2 fig 4.), after that it went down almost merging with female and unknown at the 40-minute mark and staying with them through the rest of the studied time, comparing this information with fig 3. We found that the most uses are at work hours, what I mean by that is that almost 45 thousand people where using bicycles at the entry and leaving hours from work, this means that this is the method of transportation for the common user, on Sunday and Saturday we are able to see that people tend to use it more in the afternoon between 11:00 am to 12:00 am but there is still a lot of uses after that up to 5:00 pm, this means could mean that tourist are the one using it or local people travelling to see their friends/family or restaurants or other business.

fig 4. Heatmap representing total of uses by hour by day of the week by the 3 gender of the study

Female and Male use it to get to work but as told before man use it more to get to their jobs, but there is a tendency in weekdays where both genders use it a lot between the hours expressed before where Female users do not loose numbers and use it as a transport where Male looses up to 5,000 users comparing to the workdays, and lastly unknown gets more users at the weekend, meaning that most likely they are tourist.

fig 5. Heatmap representing total of uses by hour and by day by the type of user there is

Lastly, comparing user’s vs costumer we can see that most of the people (>50%) using it are subscribers (fig 5.), most of them are Male and the days with more uses are Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday for male and female, unknown stays the same through the week. For Customers the ones that use it the most are Unknown in weekends being more like tourist as mentioned before.


For the last part we can see that almost all the individual that tend to use bikes are from 1970 up to 1995 (fig 6.), that means that the youth are more used to ride bikes to do their daily chores but the elderly tend to ride longer than the youth(fig7)

# Summary
It is possible to take this project to another city but we need to do a study first to see the age of the people and the tendency in their area, if the location of interest of the people is nearby or far away and to do a demographic study to see the ages of the people, if they are younger or orlder it might be a good idea but if it´s in between it is not possible.
To end this summary we can see a pattern, males tend to ride more bikes and to do it to get to work, females do it but in less volume but tend to ride bicycles in the weekdays and lastly there is still hope with the tourist since they like to ride bicycles to get to monuments or different significant places.
